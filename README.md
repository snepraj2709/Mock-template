# A template to build React Apps

Specifically for my machine coding rounds, to start coding a new problem without having to set up everything from the start.

## Technologies and Tools

In the project, I've used:
1. npm package library to install react-router and react-router-dom
2. FontAwesome Free Icon Library-https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free

### `Folder structure
1. Kept it minimal so that I can use this template for any new projects without deleting a lot of files and folders.
2. Added just one folder /pages within the /src
